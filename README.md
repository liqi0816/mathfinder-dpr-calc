Yet another stupid d20 DPR calculator

## Motivation

1. some calculators tried to encode all feats/buffs/modifiers. Let's face it: this is an impossible task and ignores house rule (looking at you OwlCat). I want to define modifiers myself
2. I want comments
3. I want plain text representations so I can copy and paste it around
4. I want to customize the turn as much as possible so I can account for extra bite/arrow/whatever
5. I want a nice vs-ArmorClass plot so I know when to turn on Power Attack
6. I want to compare between different builds against various ArmorClass so i know the tradeoff
7. *I want to learn Material-UI v5 the React library*

## Solution

Make a domain specific parser that can read customized modifiers/comments/turn description

Make a chart vs-ArmorClass
